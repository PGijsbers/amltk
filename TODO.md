# Pipeline
- [x] Pipeline `iter` deep and shallow
  * Done using `iter` for shallow and `traverse` for deep
- [x] Pipeline `walk` to iter like `traverse` the pipeline but get info about direct
parents and and splits 
- [x] ~~`as_dict` for dictionary representation of pipeline~~
  * See NOTES.md
- [x] `remove` and `replace` deeply
- [ ] Extracting subpipelines
  - [ ] With a mapping object
    * Should be a lot easier with the removal implementation
